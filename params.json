PMF-ML is a plugin of SBML level 3 that extends SBML to support these models.\r\n\r\n# Dependencies\r\nThis project provides a Java implementation of PMF-ML written on top of JSBML and Combine Archive Toolkit.\r\n\r\n## JSBML\r\nOpen-source and pure Java library for handling SBML files. Developed by [Andreas Drager](http://sbrg.ucsd.edu/researchers/draeger/) and [Nicolas Rodriguez](http://lenoverelab.org/members/Nicolas_Rodriguez/). More information at [http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML](http://sbml.org/Software/JSBML)\r\n\r\n## Combine Archive Toolkit\r\nJava library to create, read, write and manipulate COMBINE archives. Developed by [Martin Scharm](https://www.sbi.uni-rostock.de/team/single/martin-scharm/).
